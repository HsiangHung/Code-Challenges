To run the codes (on Mac), please  type:

./run.sh

The codes are "tweets_cleaned.py" and "average_degree.py" on the root repo.

The code "tweets_cleaned.py" reads tweets from "Input/tweets.txt"
and generates an output files in the Output folder: "ft1.txt".
Then later the code "average_degree.py" will read "ft1.txt" from the Output folder and generates
the other output file: "ft2.txt".
Thank you.
